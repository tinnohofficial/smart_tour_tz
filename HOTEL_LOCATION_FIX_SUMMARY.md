# Hotel Location System Fix Summary

## Problem
The codebase had inconsistencies in how hotel locations were handled:
- Database schema correctly used `destination_id` (foreign key to destinations table)
- Hotel profile completion form correctly used destination dropdown
- But some parts of the frontend were trying to access `hotel.location` field that didn't exist
- Hotel manager profile editing page still had old location text input
- Booking display and other components expected location data but weren't getting it

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated Hotels Controller (`fyp/backend/controllers/hotelsController.js`)**
   - Modified `getAllHotels()` to include destination information and computed location string
   - Modified `getHotelById()` to include destination information  
   - Added `getManagerProfile()` method for hotel manager profile endpoints
   - Added `updateManagerProfile()` method for updating hotel manager profiles
   - All hotel queries now return: `destination_name`, `destination_region`, and computed `location` field

2. **Updated Hotels Router (`fyp/backend/routes/hotelsRouter.js`)**
   - Added `/manager/profile` GET route for hotel managers to view their profile
   - Added `/manager/profile` PUT route for hotel managers to update their profile

3. **Database Schema (No Changes Required)**
   - Schema already correctly uses `destination_id` in hotels table
   - Destinations table provides name and region information

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Hotel Manager Service (`fyp/frontend/app/services/api.js`)**
   - Modified `getProfile()` to use `/hotels/manager/profile` endpoint
   - Modified `updateProfile()` to use `/hotels/manager/profile` endpoint  

2. **Updated Hotel Manager Profile Store (`fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/store.js`)**
   - Changed `hotelLocation` field to `hotelDestinationId`
   - Updated form data handling to use `destination_id` instead of location text
   - Fixed profile data mapping to handle destination IDs properly

3. **Updated Hotel Manager Profile Page (`fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/page.js`)**
   - Replaced location text input with destination dropdown (similar to completion form)
   - Added destinations fetching and loading states
   - Updated form submission to send `destination_id`

4. **Cleaned Up Legacy Code (`fyp/frontend/app/register/registerStore.js`)**
   - Removed unused `hotelLocation` field from hotel manager form data

## Current System Flow

1. **Hotel Manager Registration**
   - Basic registration (email, password, phone, role)
   - Redirected to complete profile page

2. **Hotel Profile Completion**
   - Hotel manager selects destination from dropdown (populated from destinations table)
   - Form submits with `destination_id`
   - Hotel record created with proper destination foreign key

3. **Hotel Display/Booking**
   - Backend joins hotels with destinations table
   - Returns computed `location` field as "Destination Name, Region"
   - Frontend displays this location string consistently

4. **Hotel Profile Management**
   - Hotel managers can update their hotel information
   - Destination selection through dropdown (no free text)
   - Updates use `destination_id` for consistency

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Data Consistency**: All hotels now have standardized location data tied to destinations
2. **No Manual Entry Errors**: Hotel managers can only select from approved destinations
3. **Simplified Booking Logic**: Exact destination matching for hotel filtering
4. **Maintainable Code**: Single source of truth for destination data
5. **Better UX**: Dropdown selection is easier than typing location names

## Files Modified

- `fyp/backend/controllers/hotelsController.js`
- `fyp/backend/routes/hotelsRouter.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/services/api.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/store.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/page.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/register/registerStore.js`

## Files That Work Correctly (No Changes Needed)

- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/complete-profile/page.js` (already used destination dropdown)
- `fyp/frontend/app/book/[id]/page.js` (displays hotel.location from backend)
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/pending-status/page.js` (displays hotel.location from backend)
- `fyp/backend/config/schema.sql` (already had correct destination_id structure)
