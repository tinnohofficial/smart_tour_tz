# Hotel & Tour Guide Location System Fix Summary

## Problem
The codebase had inconsistencies in how hotel and tour guide locations were handled:
- Database schema correctly used `destination_id` (foreign key to destinations table)
- Hotel and tour guide profile completion forms correctly used destination dropdown
- But some parts of the frontend were trying to access `hotel.location` field that didn't exist
- Hotel manager profile editing page still had old location text input
- Tour guide and hotel systems had inconsistent endpoint patterns
- Booking display and other components expected location data but weren't getting it
- Dropdown selections showed "destination name - region" but associations should be with destination name only

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated Hotels Controller (`fyp/backend/controllers/hotelsController.js`)**
   - Modified `getAllHotels()` to include destination information and computed location as destination name only
   - Modified `getHotelById()` to include destination information  
   - Added `getManagerProfile()` method for hotel manager profile endpoints
   - Added `updateManagerProfile()` method for updating hotel manager profiles
   - All hotel queries now return: `destination_name`, `destination_region`, and `location` (which is destination name)

2. **Updated Tour Guides Controller (`fyp/backend/controllers/tourGuidesController.js`)**
   - Modified `getTourGuide()` to include destination information and computed location as destination name only
   - Modified `getAllTourGuides()` and `getAvailableTourGuides()` to include destination information
   - Added `getManagerProfile()` method for tour guide manager profile endpoints
   - Added `updateManagerProfile()` method for updating tour guide manager profiles
   - All tour guide queries now return: `destination_name`, `destination_region`, and `location` (which is destination name)

3. **Updated Hotels Router (`fyp/backend/routes/hotelsRouter.js`)**
   - Added `/manager/profile` GET route for hotel managers to view their profile
   - Added `/manager/profile` PUT route for hotel managers to update their profile

4. **Updated Tour Guides Router (`fyp/backend/routes/tourGuidesRouter.js`)**
   - Added `/manager/profile` GET route for tour guides to view their profile
   - Added `/manager/profile` PUT route for tour guides to update their profile

5. **Database Schema (No Changes Required)**
   - Schema already correctly uses `destination_id` in hotels and tour_guides tables
   - Destinations table provides name and region information

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Hotel Manager Service (`fyp/frontend/app/services/api.js`)**
   - Modified `getProfile()` to use `/hotels/manager/profile` endpoint
   - Modified `updateProfile()` to use `/hotels/manager/profile` endpoint  

2. **Updated Tour Guide Service (`fyp/frontend/app/services/api.js`)**
   - Modified `getProfile()` to use `/tour-guides/manager/profile` endpoint
   - Modified `updateProfile()` to use `/tour-guides/manager/profile` endpoint
   - Added `updateAvailability()` method for tour guide availability management

3. **Updated Hotel Manager Profile Store (`fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/store.js`)**
   - Changed `hotelLocation` field to `hotelDestinationId`
   - Updated form data handling to use `destination_id` instead of location text
   - Fixed profile data mapping to handle destination IDs properly

4. **Updated Hotel Manager Profile Page (`fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/page.js`)**
   - Replaced location text input with destination dropdown (similar to completion form)
   - Added destinations fetching and loading states
   - Updated form submission to send `destination_id`

5. **Updated All Destination Dropdowns**
   - Hotel manager complete profile form now shows destination names only (not name + region)
   - Hotel manager profile edit form now shows destination names only
   - Tour guide complete profile form now shows destination names only  
   - Tour guide profile edit form now shows destination names only

6. **Updated Tour Guide Profile Display**
   - Tour guide profile page now shows location as destination name only

7. **Cleaned Up Legacy Code (`fyp/frontend/app/register/registerStore.js`)**
   - Removed unused `hotelLocation` field from hotel manager form data
   - Removed unused `location` field from tour guide form data

## Current System Flow

1. **Hotel Manager Registration**
   - Basic registration (email, password, phone, role)
   - Redirected to complete profile page

2. **Tour Guide Registration**
   - Basic registration (email, password, phone, role)
   - Redirected to complete profile page

3. **Hotel Profile Completion**
   - Hotel manager selects destination from dropdown (shows destination names only)
   - Form submits with `destination_id`
   - Hotel record created with proper destination foreign key

4. **Tour Guide Profile Completion**
   - Tour guide selects primary destination from dropdown (shows destination names only)
   - Form submits with `destination_id`
   - Tour guide record created with proper destination foreign key

5. **Hotel & Tour Guide Display/Booking**
   - Backend joins hotels/tour_guides with destinations table
   - Returns computed `location` field as destination name only
   - Frontend displays this location string consistently

6. **Hotel Profile Management**
   - Hotel managers can update their hotel information via dedicated `/manager/profile` endpoints
   - Destination selection through dropdown (no free text, shows names only)
   - Updates use `destination_id` for consistency

7. **Tour Guide Profile Management**
   - Tour guides can update their information via dedicated `/manager/profile` endpoints
   - Destination selection through dropdown (no free text, shows names only)
   - Availability toggle for accepting new tour assignments
   - Updates use `destination_id` for consistency

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Data Consistency**: All hotels and tour guides now have standardized location data tied to destinations
2. **No Manual Entry Errors**: Hotel managers and tour guides can only select from approved destinations
3. **Simplified Booking Logic**: Exact destination matching for hotel and tour guide filtering  
4. **Maintainable Code**: Single source of truth for destination data
5. **Better UX**: Dropdown selection is easier than typing location names
6. **Cleaner Association**: Entities are associated with destination names only, not name+region combinations
7. **Consistent API Patterns**: Both hotel managers and tour guides use similar `/manager/profile` endpoint patterns

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `fyp/backend/controllers/hotelsController.js`
- `fyp/backend/controllers/tourGuidesController.js`
- `fyp/backend/routes/hotelsRouter.js`
- `fyp/backend/routes/tourGuidesRouter.js`

### Frontend Services
- `fyp/frontend/app/services/api.js`

### Hotel Manager Pages
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/store.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/profile/page.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/complete-profile/page.js`

### Tour Guide Pages
- `fyp/frontend/app/tour-guide/profile/page.js`
- `fyp/frontend/app/tour-guide/complete-profile/page.js`

## Files That Work Correctly (No Changes Needed)

- `fyp/frontend/app/book/[id]/page.js` (displays hotel.location from backend)
- `fyp/frontend/app/hotel-manager/pending-status/page.js` (displays hotel.location from backend)
- `fyp/frontend/app/tour-guide/pending-status/page.js` (displays tour guide.location from backend)
- `fyp/backend/config/schema.sql` (already had correct destination_id structure for both hotels and tour_guides)

## Key Changes Summary

- **Destination Association**: Both hotels and tour guides are now consistently associated with destination **names only** (not name+region)
- **Unified API Patterns**: Both hotel managers and tour guides use `/manager/profile` endpoints
- **Clean Dropdowns**: All destination selections show destination names only
- **Consistent Location Display**: All location displays show destination names only
- **Removed Legacy Code**: Cleaned up unused location text fields from registration forms
