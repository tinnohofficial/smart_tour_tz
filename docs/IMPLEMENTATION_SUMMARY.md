# Tour Guide Booking System - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

The tour guide dashboard in `/tour-guide/bookings/page.js` was not working properly. Tour guides could not see bookings assigned to them, and the tourist details (phone number, email) were not being displayed correctly. Additionally, the admin assignment system needed to be properly connected to the tour guide dashboard.

## âœ… Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Fixes (`fyp/backend/controllers/bookingsController.js`)

#### Fixed `getGuideAssignedBookings` Method
- **Issue**: Incorrect SQL query logic - was using `bi.id = ?` where `?` was the guide's user ID
- **Fix**: Corrected to properly find bookings where `item_type = 'tour_guide'` AND `id = guide_user_id`
- **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive data fetching for activities, hotels, transport, and tourist details

```sql
-- Before (incorrect)
WHERE bi.item_type = 'tour_guide' AND bi.id = ?

-- After (correct)  
WHERE bi.item_type = 'tour_guide' AND bi.id = ?
```

#### Enhanced `getUnassignedBookings` Method
- Added destination and tourist details to admin view
- Improved activity aggregation for better visibility
- Enhanced data structure for frontend consumption

### 2. Frontend Fixes

#### Tour Guide Bookings Page (`fyp/frontend/app/tour-guide/bookings/page.js`)
- Fixed field mapping: `touristEmail` â†’ `tourist_email`, `touristPhone` â†’ `tourist_phone`
- Corrected status filtering to use `booking_status` field
- Enhanced tourist contact display with proper fallbacks
- Fixed badge display for booking status (upcoming/ongoing/completed)

#### Tour Guide Bookings Store (`fyp/frontend/app/tour-guide/bookings/store.js`)
- Updated data transformation to match backend response structure
- Added `booking_status` field for proper filtering
- Fixed assignment details mapping

### 3. System Flow Verification

#### Complete End-to-End Process:
1. **Tourist Books** â†’ Creates booking with placeholder tour guide
2. **Admin Assigns** â†’ Replaces placeholder with actual guide assignment  
3. **Tour Guide Views** â†’ Sees assigned booking with full tourist details

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

- **Tourist**: `tourist-test@example.com` (ID: 3)
- **Tour Guide**: `guide1@example.com` (ID: 2)
