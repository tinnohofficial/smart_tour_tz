1. Set up the database (tables created only if they don't exist):
   ```bash
   node backend/config/setupDatabase.js
   ```

2. Delete all tables:
   ```bash
   node backend/config/teardownDatabase.js
   ```

3. Delete a specific table:
   ```bash
   node backend/config/teardownDatabase.js table_name
   ```
