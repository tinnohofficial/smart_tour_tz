- [x] Fixed status check from 'approved' to 'active' in `getAvailableTourGuides()`

### Database Schema
- [x] Hotels table uses `destination_id` foreign key (already correct)
- [x] Tour guides table uses `destination_id` foreign key (already correct)
- [x] Destinations table provides `name` and `region` fields (already correct)

## ‚úÖ Frontend Implementation

### Service Layer
- [x] Hotel manager service uses `/hotels/manager/profile` endpoints
- [x] Tour guide service uses `/tour-guides/manager/profile` endpoints
- [x] Tour guide service includes `updateAvailability()` method

### Hotel Manager Pages
- [x] Complete profile form uses destination dropdown with names only
- [x] Profile edit page uses destination dropdown with names only
- [x] Profile store uses `hotelDestinationId` instead of `hotelLocation`
- [x] Form submission sends `destination_id`

### Tour Guide Pages
- [x] Complete profile form uses destination dropdown with names only
- [x] Profile edit page uses destination dropdown with names only
- [x] Profile page displays location as destination name only
- [x] Form submission sends `destination_id`

### Legacy Code Cleanup
- [x] Removed `hotelLocation` field from register store
- [x] Removed `location` field from tour guide register store
- [x] All destination dropdowns show names only (not name + region)

## ‚úÖ Testing Verification Points

### Hotel Manager Flow

- [ ] Destination dropdown shows names only during profile completion
- [ ] Profile saves with correct `destination_id`
- [ ] Profile edit page shows current destination selected
- [ ] Hotel location displays as destination name in booking views
- [ ] Manager profile endpoints return correct data

### Tour Guide Flow
- [ ] Tour guide can register and complete profile
- [ ] Destination dropdown shows names only during profile completion
- [ ] Profile saves with correct `destination_id`
- [ ] Profile edit page shows current destination selected
- [ ] Tour guide location displays as destination name in views
- [ ] Manager profile endpoints return correct data
- [ ] Availability toggle works correctly

### Data Consistency
- [ ] Hotels filtered by exact destination_id match in booking process
- [ ] Tour guides filtered by exact destination_id match in assignment process
- [ ] No orphaned location text fields in any forms
- [ ] All location displays show destination names consistently

## ‚úÖ API Endpoints

### Hotel Manager
